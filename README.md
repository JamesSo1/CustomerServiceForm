# Customer Feedback Form

## Project Description

This project consists of a webpage containing a customer feedback form. The goal of this form is to allow users to input their feedback from any device in a simple manner. This is done through the use of media queries to create a responsive webpage as well as the use of various form types such as radio buttons, text boxes, and a date selector form.

This webpage is static and the form's data, when submitted, does not get sent anywhere. In the future, I will look to make this webpage more dynamic through the implementation of JavaScript. In addition, I will look to add an additional webpage for when the user submits the form. This additional webpage would simply confirm that the user's responses have been sent. When it comes to setting a destination to which the form would be sent, I plan on having the form data not be sent anywhere and therefore plan on having the form data reamin unrecorderd.
